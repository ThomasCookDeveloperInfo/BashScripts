# BashScripts
Just a random collection of bash scripts

serviceScript.sh can be used to generate a system dump of all services running on USB attached android device. The script will generate a file called servicesList.txt which contains a list of all the services running on the device as well as a .txt file for each service dump. There are currently no args for the script, it simply just dumps the logs in the directory from where the script was run.
